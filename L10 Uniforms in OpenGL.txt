Uniform variables in OpenGL

Previously, we have looked at vertex attributes which also allows transfer of data. Vertex attributes are set per vertex. Every new vertex has a new attribute. Uniform variables very much behave in the same way. 

Uniforms variables allow data transfer from the CPU to the GPU. Uniforms are set per draw. 

So before glDrawElements, a uniform can be created and used. 

See the Basic.shader

Note: You must have a shader buffer bound (selected) before sending any data to it.
