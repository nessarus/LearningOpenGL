Using Modern OpenGL in C++

So far we have used OpenGL libraries to create a basic triangle shape. In order to get more advanced and updated functions, we must import GLEW.

Those functions already implemented in your GPU drivers. GLEW will reference those functions into OpenGL cross platform.

Download GLEW from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/

Copy and import the lib and include files into the project.

Check the doc folder for the documentation to each of the libraries.
