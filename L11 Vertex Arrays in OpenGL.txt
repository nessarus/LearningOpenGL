Vertex Arrays in OpenGL

We have covered vertex buffers however vertex array are slightly different. 

Vertex arrays are a way to customize the vertex buffers layout. 

Note: Vertex arrays do not exist in DirectX. They are unique to OpenGL. 

So that means we are finding a way to adjust glVertexAttribPointer using a vertex array. This will help managed buffer binding.
