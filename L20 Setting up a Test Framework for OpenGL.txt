Setting up a Test Framework for OpenGL

We are creating an application to create a scene. This application will have menu to load scenes, objects and animations.
First we should clean up entire code base.


1. Create a folder called tests in src.
2. Create Test.h, TestClearColor.cpp, TestClearColor.h

Homework:

Create a menu selecting tests
    click on test -> creates it and opens it 
    if you go back from that menu -> it should delete that instance of that class
    make more than one test
        textures
        quad with more than one texture color
        quad with a uniform that you can customize
