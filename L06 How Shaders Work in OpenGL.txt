How Shaders Work in OpenGL

Shaders program run on the GPU. Graphics programming is important to use the 
GPU to draw graphics. Please note not all programming will be done on the GPU, CPU
is also important.

We need to specify the position, color, lighting, etc...

Shader types: Vertex Shaders, Fragment Shaders. 
 - note: there are more than these two types of shaders but they are rarely 
    used and more advanced

Graphics pipeline (many states skipped):
    1. Draw Call
    2. Vertex Shader called
    3. Fragment Shader called
    4. See Result on screen

Vertex Shader is called for each vertex. The primary purpose of the vertex shader is 
to specify the location of the vertex to be. Secondary purpose is to pass attributes into
the next stage. Transformation here as well.

Fragment Shader is roughly equivalent to pixels. Fragment Shader decides what colour 
each pixel is.
