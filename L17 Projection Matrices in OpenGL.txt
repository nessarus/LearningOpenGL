Projection Matrices in OpenGL

Projection are how we go from an arbitrary coordinate system to our window in our 3D space. Our 3D world has to be projected onto our 2D window.

We convert our coordinate matrix into normalized device coordinate. Left side is -1, right side is 1, bottom of the screen is -1 and the top is 1.

Model View Projection Matrices in OpenGL

Model view projection matrices are used to transform whatever space we're dealing with to coordinate system.

Translation, rotation, scale.
