Vertex Attributes and Layouts in OpenGL

Since last lecture we were missing parts to get our triangle working.
    Vertex Shaders
    Vertex Attributes

The OpenGL pipeline works by:
    Providing data to GPU
    Store content on the memory of the GPU (Vertex Buffer)
    Shaders programs are run on the GPU to instruct the GPU what to draw

When a shader reads a vertex buffer it need to know the layout of the buffer (Vertex Attributes).

We are going to be looking at glVertexAttribPointer.
