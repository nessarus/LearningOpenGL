Writing a Basic Renderer in OpenGL

Today we are writing a renderer. What we have at the moment are a bunch of classes that get created, bound and drawn. This is rather inconvenient because none of this is going through a central pipeline. We still have to write code to move vertex's from start to finish every time. 

The renderer is like the OpenGl factory.
