Vertex Buffers and Drawing a Triangle in OpenGL

Drawing a triangle in modern OpenGL:
    Creating a vertex buffer
    Creating a vertex shader

    Vertex Buffer:
        Vertex means array (C++ made a mistake in naming convention), buffer is just memory storage
        Vertex buffer is an OpenGL buffer so the memory is stored in GPU -> Video RAM (VRAM).

    We need to tell the GPU how to read the elements in the Vertex Buffer and draw it on the screen.

    Vertex Shader:
        Vertex Shaders are programs we write to run on the GPU. 


OpenGL drawing modes:
    OpenGL operates as a State Machine. We tell it which program to run (shader) and what input it has
    (buffer). Then it executes a draw triangle command. 

    The shader and buffer will adjust where the location and properties of that triangle.
