How I Deal with Shaders in OpenGL

Shaders are not really supposed to be taken in with a string. 
We will need a way to take them in as a file. 

OpenGL encourages placing vertex and fragment shaders in separate files. This however is not necessary. We can write it all in one file (the Direct X way).

1. Under Solution -> ProjectName
    create a new folders:
        .. -> res -> shaders
2. Create a Basic.shader file 
3. Copy the shader strings into Basic.shader


Debugging file directory
To check the directory the shader files searched for in:
1. Right-click project -> properties

2. Under Debugging -> Working Directory
